# CLBHSTool

A plugin for AssettoServer that adds additional commands to be used with the Clubhouse Admin Tool.
This plugin uses code from [AssettoServer by Compujuckel](https://github.com/compujuckel/AssettoServer).

This is probably really bad code. But I dont know it any better.
Made with the help of random internet users and AI.


Enable the plugin in your extra_cfg.yml file. Make sure the port you want to use is open.
```
EnablePlugins:
[CLBHSToolPlugin]
```
```
---
!CLBHSToolPluginConfiguration
LogTcpPort: *YOUR PORT*
```
